                <p class="lead" >
             An FIR is an account of a cognizable (i.e. over which police has jurisdiction) offence that is entered in a particular format in a register at the police station. Every person has a right to report any matter at the concerned police station and have a case registered in the form of an FIR. The matter may be reported orally or in writing to an officer at a police station or on patrol. An officer who receives an oral report shall reduce it to writing and cause it to be recorded in the FIR register. A certified copy of the FIR, signed by an officer bearing the stamp of the police station is to be provided to the person who reports the crime. <br>
	  No police officer has the authority to refuse registration of a case. In case a crime is reported and a case is not registered, the person who reports the crime must inform the Sub-Divisional Police Officer or the Superintendent of Police or the District Police Officer responsible for the area. .</p>
